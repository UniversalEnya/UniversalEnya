### Deity’s Form

https://bacon-bagel-games.itch.io/deitys-form

Deity’s Form is an Isometric Rogue-lite hack and slash action video game, where you play as a powerful being who was sealed away for many years to prevent you from causing a predicted great calamity. Climb up floors of the Prison, fights through their hoards, and taste freedom once more. I collaborated with a team of classmates to create this game for our final year Game Design Course "Major Project" assignment, at TU Dublin. 

I directed the design for a rock-paper-scissors style hack-&-slash combat, with gameplay that encourages strategic thinking while still allowing the player to feel powerful. I also created much of the game’s visual style, such as the 2D art style, the colour palette, the background, and the player character’s design.
